Three.js Experiment

To see the code in action, go to http://pkflash.zxq.net/ 

(No longer having web host issues, but pretty much only works with the latest version of chrome (and you need appropriate hardware to be able to view the graphics).)

Just as a disclaimer: I did not make the three.js library (obviously). I am still a noob when it comes to github. I posted the whole library even though all I needed was the three.min.js file (haha oops). The only files that I made myself (well, with the help of online tutorials) are the main.js, index.html and the style.css files.
