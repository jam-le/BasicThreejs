Three.js Experiment

(No longer having web host issues, but only works with chrome 21 or after (and you need appropriate hardware to be able to view the graphics).)

Just as a disclaimer: I did not make the three.js library (obviously). I am still a noob when it comes to github. I posted the whole library even though all I needed was the three.min.js file (haha oops). The only files that I made myself are the main.js, index.html and the style.css files.
